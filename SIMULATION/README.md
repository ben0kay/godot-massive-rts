# SIMULATION

`UnitState.cs` owns stable-ID, world-space soldier arrays and the flat-ground height seam. `MovementSystem.cs` performs shared marching; `SpatialGrid.cs` reuses linked-cell storage with faction-separated heads and bounded queries. BENCHMARK configuration supplies limits. Dead IDs remain allocated until reset, but are excluded from simulation/indexing and removed from rendering. Positions are authoritative; there are no per-unit scene nodes. Terrain elevation and collision avoidance are not implemented.
