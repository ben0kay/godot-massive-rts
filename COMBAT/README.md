# COMBAT

Benchmark-only rules, not final combat gameplay. `CombatSystem.cs` acquires local targets on staggered ticks and performs cooldown attacks. Damage mutates SIMULATION state. Ranged attacks launch pooled shots through [PROJECTILES](../PROJECTILES/README.md).

UNIT0 reads damage, armour, attack cadence and range from the compiled unit catalogue. Projectiles carry their shooter’s damage and use defender footprint in collision checks.
